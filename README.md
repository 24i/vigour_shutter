vigour-img
==================

Makes a sprite out of an array of urls

## Dependencies
ImageMagick `brew install ImageMagick`

<a name='api'></a>
## Usage
- Start the server (`npm start`)
- Issue a GET request to one of the following addresses to obtain the sprite corresponding to the provided parameters.
    + `/sprite/:country/:lang/shows/:width/:height`
    + `/sprite/:country/:lang/episodes/:showId/:seasonId/:width/:height`

### Parameters
- `:country` A full country name, like **Germany**
- `:lang` A language code, like **nl**
- `:showId` A show id, like **195**
- `:seasonsId` A season id, like **458**
- `:width` Desired width for each tile
- `:height` Desired height for each tile

The parameters (except for `:width` and `:height`) will be used to dig through the available data and find an object whose values (as opposed to keys) are objects containing an `img` property. For each element in this object, the `img` property is converted to a url with `url = 'http://images.mtvnn.com/' + img + '/306x172'`. The image found at that url is downloaded, resized and cropped to the desired width and height. When this is done for each element in the object, the images are assembled side by side as a horizontal sprite, saved as jpg, and sent back to the requester. If anything unexpected happens during this process, a plain text error message is sent back to the requester.

            "channels": {
                "img": String,
                "number": Number
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Known issues
```
Error creating sprite: Error: Command failed: gm convert: No decode delegate for this image format (tmp/<temporary_directory_name>/<image_id>).
```
If you get this error when requesting a sprite, trying again often works. If not, make sure the data is correct (the provided image ids should correspond to existing images at `http://images.mtvnn.com/<image_id>/306x172`)
